# THE ABC OF PROGRAMMING
### A
What is a script and how to create one?

### B
How does the computer fit with the world around them?

### C
How to write a script for a web page?

# A
A script is a series of instructions that a 
computer can follow to achieve a goal. 
#### You could compare scripts to any of the following
+ RECIPES 
+ HANDBOOKS
+ MANUALS

And a script could be definde as they are made up of instructions a computer can follow step-by-step

A browser may use different parts of the script depending on how the user interact with the web page it self.

#### WRITING A SCRIPT 
To write a script, you need to first 
state your goal and then list the 
tasks that need to be completed in 
order to achieve it.

Start with the big picture of what 
you want to achieve, and break 
that down into smaller steps. 


1. DEFINE THE GOAL 
First, you need to define the task you want to 
achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for the 
computer to solve. 


2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT 
To design a script you split the goal out into a series 
of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this 
puzzle. This can be represented using a flowchart. 
You can then write down individual steps that the 
computer needs to perform in order to complete 
each individual task (and any information it needs to 
perform the task), rather like writing a recipe that it 
can follow. 


3. CODE EACH STEP 
Each of the steps needs to be written in a 
programming language that the compu ter 
understands. In our case, this is JavaScript.
