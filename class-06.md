# Forms 
## Why Forms?

In addition to enabling users to 
search, forms also allow users 
to perform other functions 
online. You will see forms 
when registering as a member 
of a website, when shopping 
online, and when signing up for 
newsletters or mailing lists.

# Events 

W hen you browse the web, your browser registers different 
types of events. It's the browser's way of saying, "Hey, this 
just happened." Your script can then respond to these events. 
Scripts often respond to these events by updating the content of the web page (via the 
Document Object Model) which makes the page feel more interactive. In this chapter, you 
will learn how:

Events occur when users When an event occurs, In the last chapter, you

requested has loaded. different parts of the page. web page reacts to users.


## HOW EVENTS TRIGGER JAVASCRIPT CODE 
When the user interacts with the HTML on a web page, there are three 
steps involved in getting it to trigger some JavaScript code. 
Together these steps are known as event handling. 

## Select t he element node(s) you want the script to respond to. 
For example, if you want to 
trigger a function when a user 
clicks on a specific link, you need 
to get the DOM node for that 
link element. You do this using a 
DOM query (see Chapter 5). 
The UI events that relate to the 
browser window (rather than the 
HTML page loaded in it) work 
with the window object rather 
than an element node. Examples 
include the events that occur 
when a requested page has 
finished loading, or when the 
user scrolls. You will learn about 
using these on p272. 
8 EVENTS 

## Indicate which event on the selected node(s) will trigger the response. 
Programmers call this binding an 
event to a DOM node. 
The previous two pages showed 
a selection of the popular events 
that you can monitor for. 
Some events work with most 
element nodes, such as the 
mouseover event, which is 
triggered when the user rolls 
over any element. Other events 
only work with specific element 
nodes, such as the submit event, 
which only works with a form. 

 
## State the code you want 
to run when the event 
occurs. 

W hen the event occurs, on a 
specified element, it will trigger 
a function. This may be a named 
or an anonymous function. 
Here you can see how event handling can be used to provide feedback to 
users filling in a registration form. It will show an error message if their 
username is too short.
