# HTML Lists
lists are very importent to organize and list things in our lives and **HTML** has this kind of thing and it provides us with
and it three different types:

+ **Ordered lists** are lists where each item in the list is 
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for 
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract 
where each point needs to be identified by a section 
number.

+ **Unordered** lists are lists that begin with a bullet point 
(rather than characters that indicate order)

+ **Definition** lists are made up of a set of terms along with the 
definitions for each of those terms.

## Ordered List
## \<ol>

The ordered list is created with 
the \<ol> element.
## \<li>
 
Each item in the list is placed 
between an opening \<li> tag 
and a closing \</li> tag. (The li
stands for list item.)
Browsers indent lists by default.

Sometimes you may see a type
attribute used with the \<ol>
element to specify the type of 
numbering (numbers, letters, 
roman numerals and so on).

## Unordered List
## \<ul>
The unordered list is created 
with the \<ul> element.
## \<li>
Each item in the list is placed 
between an opening \<li> tag 
and a closing \</li> tag. (The li
stands for list item.)

Browsers indent lists by default.
Sometimes you may see a type
attribute used with the \<ul>
element to specify the type of 
bullet point (circles, squares, 
diamonds and so on).

## Definition Lists

## \<dl>
The definition list is created with 
the \<dl> element and usually 
consists of a series of terms and 
their definitions.

Inside the \<dl> element you will 
usually see pairs of \<dt> and 
\<dd> elements.
## \<dt>
This is used to contain the term 
being defined (the definition 
term).
## \<dd>
This is used to contain the 
definition.
  
Sometimes you might see a list 
where there are two terms used 
for the same definition or two 
different definitions for the same 
term.
